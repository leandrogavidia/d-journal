# D-Journal

## It's a DApp to create your decentralized journal, now you can own what you write.

Add notes to the BNB Chain (testnet) blockchain, these are stored in a decentralized network, your notes aren't stored in a central server o in an interface. Only you can add, delete, change or download your notes.

Why a decentralized journal? For concept. A journal is a private and intimate thing, only you should read it or write on it.
